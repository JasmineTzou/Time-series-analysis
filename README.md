Inadequate taxi availability during peak hours leads to long waiting times for passengers, 
resulting in decreased customer satisfaction and lost revenue opportunities for taxi companies.

Therefore, would like to predict the demands for taxi per hour, in order to give suggestion to the taxi companies
for their amount increase and decrease in different hours.
